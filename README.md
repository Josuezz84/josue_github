### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
This project uses Python to analyze bike-sharing system data from three U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, the goal is to create a script that loads the datasets, processes the information, and generates descriptive statistics to answer key usage questions, the program also offers an interactive terminal interface to display these results in real time.

### Files used
All the coding will be done in the bikeshare.py file, in addition, you will need three dataset files, one for each city, that will be used as the data source for the analysis.

Bikeshare.py → Main Python script for data analysis.
chicago.csv → Dataset containing bikeshare data for Chicago.
new_york_city.csv → Dataset containing bikeshare data for New York City.
washington.csv → Dataset containing bikeshare data for Washington.

### Dataset

The datasets include randomly selected records from the first six months of 2017 for each city. All files follow the same format and share six (6) core columns, making it easier to process them together, you can also get the raw data preview 5 lines at a time.

### How to Run

using the terminal you can run the file by entering: python bikeshare.py
